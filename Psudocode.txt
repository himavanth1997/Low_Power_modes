[PS : psudo code is based on Naive Bayes Binary classification for other classifications algorithm would be littile different.]

Psudo code:
1. Resetting all pheriperals and initilizing flash, systick.
2. Intilize the bus clocks,ram clocks and periperal clocks.
3. Intilizing a pointer to dataset containing Naive Baye's Theorm input data.
3. Setting up the unused GPIO's to Analog mode(to minimize the power consumption).
4. Initilizing RTC and setting up the clocks, interrupts.
5. Infinite While LOOP: 
			[- Enable clock to all GPIO's.]
			[- Setting the GPIO to analog input mode.]
			[- Disabling the GPIO clocks.]
			- RUN the Naive Baye's Binary therom on dataset to determine the output.
			- Disabling the RTC timer interrupts.
			- Clearing the PWR_FLAG_WU.
			- Setting up the wake up timer interrupt to 10ms.
			- Entering the micro controller to STOP 0 mode.
			- System clock configuration after waking it from STOP mode.
